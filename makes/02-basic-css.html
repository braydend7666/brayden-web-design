    <h4>
    Skyrush is my favortite coaster because of the intense g-force that you feel. From 5 through -2 G's you feel like the train will rip off the tracks. By far the most intense Coaster I have ever rode. It is sad that I don't live near it because I would love this coaster near me!

    <h4>
    Skyrush is a twister coaster. This means it takes up a very small footprint. Twister coasters are more intense then other coasters because elements are take at a much faster pace with tighter elements
